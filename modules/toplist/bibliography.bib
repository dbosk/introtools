  abstract = {Despite active learning being recognized as a 
              superior method of instruction in the classroom, a 
              major recent survey found that most college STEM 
              instructors still choose traditional teaching 
              methods. This article addresses the long-standing 
              question of why students and faculty remain 
              resistant to active learning. Comparing passive 
              lectures with active learning using a randomized 
              experimental approach and identical course 
              materials, we find that students in the active 
              classroom learn more, but they feel like they learn 
              less. We show that this negative correlation is 
              caused in part by the increased cognitive effort 
              required during active learning. Faculty who adopt 
              active learning are encouraged to intervene and 
              address this misperception, and we describe a 
              successful example of such an intervention.We 
              compared students{\textquoteright} self-reported 
              perception of learning with their actual learning 
              under controlled conditions in large-enrollment 
              introductory college physics courses taught using 
              1) active instruction (following best practices in 
              the discipline) and 2) passive instruction 
              (lectures by experienced and highly rated 
              instructors). Both groups received identical class 
              content and handouts, students were randomly 
              assigned, and the instructor made no effort to 
              persuade students of the benefit of either method. 
              Students in active classrooms learned more (as 
              would be expected based on prior research), but 
              their perception of learning, while positive, was 
              lower than that of their peers in passive 
              environments. This suggests that attempts to 
              evaluate instruction based on 
              students{\textquoteright} perceptions of learning 
              could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) 
              pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar 
              lecturer could create such a positive feeling of 
              learning that students would choose those lectures 
              over active learning. Most importantly, these 
              results suggest that when students experience the 
              increased cognitive effort associated with active 
              learning, they initially take that effort to 
              signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a 
              detrimental effect on students{\textquoteright} 
              motivation, engagement, and ability to 
              self-regulate their own learning. Although students 
              can, on their own, discover the increased value of 
              being actively engaged during a semester-long 
              course, their learning may be impaired during the 
              initial part of the course. We discuss strategies 
              that instructors can use, early in the semester, to 
              improve students{\textquoteright} response to being 
              actively engaged in the classroom.},
