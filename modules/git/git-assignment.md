- [ ] Create a file `history.txt` by redirecting the output of the `history` 
  command into the file. (You should've learned how to do this, now prove it!)

- [ ] Add and commit that file to your *local* repository, then *push* it to 
  the *remote* repository on KTH GitHub.

- [ ] Tick these (<-- to the left) boxes to show that you're done. (Put an 'x' 
  between the square brackets, like the one below.) Remember to commit and push 
  these changes too!

- [x] This is already done.
