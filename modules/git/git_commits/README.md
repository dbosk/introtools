This is a module intending to teach first-year engineering students about what 
a good git committing behaviour looks like, what a good message looks like and 
why they want to follow that behaviour.

There is a presentation in the [slides-directory](slides/). It has been largely 
based on the work done by Amanda Berg and Simon Osnes in their bachelor's 
degree project from 2021. Please refer to [the summary of the relevant parts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1emMWhN-MbPgIkLxLoTEL-98FRPMu-oD9lh0nBosCc9A/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.
Please refer to [the project report in its entirety](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3489&pid=diva2%3A1599553&c=1&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=Amanda+Berg&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all) for even more details.
