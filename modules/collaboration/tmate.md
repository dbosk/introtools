# Party in the terminal

Sometimes (most times, actually) it's nice to have someone to work with, to air 
thoughts and discuss problems and possible solutions.

There are various solutions available that solve different parts of the 
problem. You've encountered [Zoom][zoom] for video conferencing. While Zoom 
supports sharing the screen, it needs a complement sometimes.

One such complement is [tmate][tmate]. This is available as the command `tmate` 
on KTH systems (e.g. `student-shell`). When you start tmate, it opens a 
terminal session that *others can join*, giving you the possibility to work in 
a group in the same terminal. For instance, when you ask for help during the 
remote lab sessions, tmate might be useful.

## Some useful tools

Video chat:

 - [Zoom][zoom]
 - [Jitsi][jitsi]
 - [Teams][teams]
 - [Discord][discord]

Asynchronous chat:

 - [Zulip][zulip]
 - [Slack][slack]
 - [Teams][teams]
 - [Discord][discord]

Terminal sharing and pair programming:

 - [tmate][tmate]
 - plugins for [various][pairprog1] [editors][pairprog2]

Explore some of these tools to get a feel for what they can do and which you 
like the most.

# Pair programming

You should read two articles:

  1. [Strengthening the Case for Pair Programming][pairprog-magazine] (just 
     signup if you don't have a FeedbackFruits account already)
  2. [The Costs and Benefits of Pair Programming][pairprog-benefits]

The first is from an academic magazine (lighter to digest) and the second is a 
scientific article ("has a bit more fibre" and requires the first for 
background details).

[pairprog-magazine]: https://eu.feedbackfruits.com/courses/activity-course/1a3d3978-afbe-43d2-9d4a-216c3f21efe9
[pairprog-benefits]: https://eu.feedbackfruits.com/courses/activity-course/73587dce-a191-44ad-8b60-e1ae2744963b

You can also see [this guide][pairprog3] for more practical suggestions on pair 
programming.

## Assignment

Set up a *remote* pair-programming environment with someone. (There's nothing 
to hand in, just take the opportunity to explore this now while you have the 
chance.)
