## Any time

Use the discussions feature in Canvas. Post your question and you will 
eventually get an answer.


## During lab sessions

To get help during the lab sessions (see [your schedule][schedule] for when 
they are), you should do the following.

[schedule]: https://www.kth.se/social/home/personal-menu/schema/

Set up [Zoom][zoom-guide] and host a new meeting (see +@fig:new). In the 
meeting room, select "Participants" at the bottom of the screen and find the 
"Invite" button (see +@fig:participants). Then click "Copy invite link" (see 
+@fig:invite).

Head to the [help queue][queue]. Use the invite link as the location and hit 
"join queue" to join the queue to wait for help (see +@fig:queue). When it's 
your turn, a tutor will join your Zoom meeting.

[queue]: http://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/DD1301
