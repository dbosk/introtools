# Course outline

This is a short course given the first two weeks of the autumn semester.

This course gives a general introduction to the KTH computer environment with a 
special focus on control of a computer from the command line (Bash), remote 
access to KTH systems (SSH), version control of course work (Git and GitHub) 
and production of technical reports (LaTeX).


## Structure

The course consists of three modules: the terminal and SSH, collaboration and 
version control, and finally, report writing with LaTeX. Each module contains 
video material, reading material, an interactive tutorial session, and one or 
more lab assignments.

### Interactive tutorial sessions

## Deadlines and passing the course

To pass the course and get credits in LADOK, you must complete the assignments. 
These assignments are constructed in such a way that we can check if you've 
completed them (e.g. logged into a system). We check the assignments by 
automation.

Our grading bot runs once per day. So don't panic if you don't get feedback 
immediately.

Once per week, complete results are reported to LADOK. Then you get credits. 
The date reported to LADOK is when you completed the last assignment.

Thanks to this automation, you can complete the assignments of the course at 
any time you like to get credits --- even next year. But you should study the 
material already now, since you're expected to know how to use the computer 
systems in courses you take now.

### Help after the course

After the course (i.e. after the first two weeks of the semester), help within 
the course is limited to other students replying in the Canvas forum. But you 
can find help from the tutors of [Allmänhandledningen][allänhandledningen].
