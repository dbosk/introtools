This is the documentation for the grading script for the [[guide]] assignment.

The end goal of the [[guide]] assignment is that the students log into the 
[[student-shell]] system over SSH. We can run a shell script which queries the 
users who've signed in and simply tick our students off.

<<grade-guide.sh>>=
ssh student-shell.sys.kth.se last > loggedin
<<tick students off>>
rm loggedin
