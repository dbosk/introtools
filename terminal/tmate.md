# Party in the terminal

Sometimes (most times, actually) it's nice to have someone to work with, to air 
thoughts and discuss problems and possible solutions.

There are various solutions available that solve different parts of the 
problem. You've encountered [Zoom][zoom] for video conferencing. While Zoom 
supports sharing the screen, it needs a complement sometimes.

One such complement is [tmate][tmate]. This is available as the command `tmate` 
on KTH systems (e.g. `student-shell`). When you start tmate, it opens a 
terminal session that *others can join*, giving you the possibility to work in 
a group in the same terminal. For instance, when you ask for help during the 
remote lab sessions, tmate might be useful.
