Now we should grade the LaTeX assignment.

We will use the [[canvas]] command to report the grades.
This must be installed from
\begin{center}
  \texttt{https://github.com/dbosk/canvasy}.
\end{center}

We will use the [[repobee]] command to clone the repos containing the LaTeX 
reports.
This must be installed from
\begin{center}
  \texttt{https://repobee.org}.
\end{center}

This script will be a make include file to be able to keep state more easily.
The main target is [[grade]].

\section{Setup}

We will keep students who must be graded in [[students-to-grade.tsv]].
Once we've reported them to Canvas, we can remove them from that list.
This list will contain their Canvas ID (first column) and their KTH username 
(second column).
We add [[students-to-grade.tsv]] as a prerequisite to [[grade]], then it will 
be created when necessary.
<<set up students to grade>>=
[ -e ${REMAINING_STUDENTS} ] || \
  canvas users -c ${COURSE_CODE} -s | cut -f 1,2 > ${REMAINING_STUDENTS}
@ We set the variables in the [[<<variables>>]] block.
<<variables>>=
COURSE_CODE=DD1301HT201
REMAINING_STUDENTS=students-to-grade.tsv
@

The LaTeX reports that we should grade are found in repos on KTH GitHub, in the 
datintro20 organization:
\begin{center}
  \texttt{https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/datintro20}.
\end{center}
We'll use [[repobee]] to clone those repos.
<<clone repos>>=
[ -d repos ] || \
  clone_repos
@
<<functions>>=
function clone_repos() {
  mkdir -p repos
  cut -f 2 ${REMAINING_STUDENTS} | \
    sed "s/@kth.se//" > repos/students-to-grade.tsv
  cd repos && \
    repobee repos clone \
      --sf students-to-grade.tsv -o ${GH_ORG} --discover-repos
}
@
<<variables>>=
GH_ORG=datintro20
@

We add cleaning as part of the [[distclean]] target.
<<clean up>>=
#rm -f -R repos
@


\section{Grading}

To grade, we iterate through the remaining students.
We check if the student has solved the assignment, if not we continue to the 
next.
Otherwise we grade the student and remove it from the list.
<<grade remaining students>>=
for s in $(cat students-to-grade.tsv | cut -f 2 | sed "s/@kth.se//");
do
  <<check the repo, set grade variable>>
  canvas grade -c "${COURSE_CODE}" -a "${ASSIGNMENT}" \
    -u $(grep $s students-to-grade.tsv | cut -f 1) -g ${grade} \
    -m "$(read_feedback $s)"
  clean_feedback $s
  sed -i "/$s/d" students-to-grade.tsv
done
@ We must set the [[ASSIGNMENT]] variable.
We will set it to a regular expression matching both terminal assignments.
<<variables>>=
ASSIGNMENT="(Git|LaTeX)"
@

We add a set of functions to deal with feedback.
The [[add_feedback]] function adds feedback to the student's feedback file,
[[read_feedback]] reads it out and [[clean_feedback]] removes the feedback 
file.
We will put any feedback into the [[feedback-<user>.md]] file.
<<functions>>=
function add_feedback() {
  echo ${@:2} >> feedback-$1.md
}
function read_feedback() {
  [ -e feedback-$1.md ] && cat feedback-$1.md
}
function clean_feedback() {
  rm -f feedback-$1.md
}
@

We must check the repo for the required parts in the LaTeX report.
The requirements specifies
\begin{itemize}
\item a title,
\item a table of contents,
\item a figure,
\item a citations with a reference,
\item a listing containing the output of the history command.
\end{itemize}
We will search for a [[.tex]] file and simply grep(1) that file for the 
requirements.
Then we look through all files for the [[history]] command.
<<check the repo, set grade variable>>=
[ -d repos/$s ] || continue
grade=1
find repos/$s -type f -name \*.tex > texfiles-$s
if ! [ $(wc -l texfiles-$s | cut -f 1 -d " ") -gt 0 ]; then
  grade=0 && add_feedback $s no tex files found
fi
if ! check_student $s texfiles-$s "documentclass"; then
  grade=0 && add_feedback $s no documentclass found
fi
if ! check_student $s texfiles-$s "\\\\title"; then
  grade=0 && add_feedback $s no title found
fi
if ! check_student $s texfiles-$s "\\\\maketitle"; then
  grade=0 && add_feedback $s no title page generated
fi
if ! check_student $s texfiles-$s "\\\\tableofcontents"; then
  grade=0 && add_feedback $s no table of contents found
fi
if ! check_student $s texfiles-$s "\\\\begin{(.*figure|table)}"; then
  grade=0 && add_feedback $s no figure found
fi
if ! check_student $s texfiles-$s "\\\[a-z\]*cite"; then
  grade=0 && add_feedback $s no citation found
fi
if ! check_student $s texfiles-$s "\\\\.*lst(input)?listing"; then
  grade=0 && add_feedback $s no listing found
fi
rm -f texfiles-$s
find repos/$s -type f > allfiles-$s
if ! check_student $s allfiles-$s "history"; then
  grade=0
  add_feedback $s no history found
fi
rm -f allfiles-$s
@

The [[check_student]] function will grep(1) the files for the provided regex.
It will print and return false if the test failed.
<<functions>>=
function check_student() {
  cat "$2" | xargs -d "\n" egrep "$3" > /dev/null
  if [ $? = 0 ]; then
    true
  else
    echo "$1 failed $3"
    false
  fi
}
