# 2020

- Rewrote all labs, except Git: terminal, ssh [new], LaTeX.

- Rewrote the lectures.

## Suggestions to fix for 2021 round

- Extend the lectures from 1h format.

- Must prepare less intense lectures, prerecord them. Must prepare 
  exercises/tutorials to replace the lectures.

- Better introduction to the various operating systems (Windows, Mac, Ubuntu).

- Improve the material and lab related to the terminal. This is where they need 
  to spend more time.

- Revise the Git lab, it was mentioned as a bit unclear.

- Add more formative feedback in the grading script. Alternatively set a 
  grading rubric for the TAs to use.

- Emphasize focus on the terminal and Git. That LaTeX can wait and the 
  automated grading will run throughout the year.

- Better motivation why the terminal is more powerful. Add simple examples of 
  automation. Useful for running experiments (e.g. in labs and theses).

- Emphasize preparation for the lectures.
