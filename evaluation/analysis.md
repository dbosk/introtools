The studien√§mnd for one of the programmes ran a course evaluation among their 
students. We also ran a course evaluation within the course. However, that one 
ran quite late and some students mixed it up with another course; so it's not 
entirely certain which course all comments are for. But there are many clear 
cases that can be used.

None, since the course is only two weeks long.

The course consisted of three one-hour lectures and three lab assignments 
(mandatory to get a grade), one of each on the topcis: the terminal, Git, 
LaTeX. The content of the lectures was updated (changed lecturer). The labs 
were also changed to bed for automated grading.

Yes, it corresponds.

The students' results didn't differ significantly despite including several 
other programmes.

The lectures were too intense and at a too advanced level. They needed more 
detailed coverage for how to get started on different OSes.

The one-hour lectures are too short to actually teach the topic. Specifically 
the first, which introduces the terminal, where a large portion of the time is 
consumed by an introduction to the course.

Women students reported lower on the LEQ statements than men, which is 
unacceptable no matter the reason. Students with any disability were happier 
than the rest.
